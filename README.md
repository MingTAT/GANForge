# GANForge

GANForge is an open-source repository for training and generating images using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN).

## Introduction

GANForge provides a powerful framework for image generation using DCGAN, a type of generative model. With GANForge, you can train and generate high-quality images with impressive realism and diversity. It leverages the power of deep convolutional neural networks to learn and recreate patterns, textures, and visual concepts.

## Features

- Implementation of DCGAN for image generation
- Easy-to-use interface for training and generating images
- Customizable network architecture and hyperparameters
- Dataset management and preprocessing utilities
- Pre-trained models and example code for quick start

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MingTAT/GANForge.git

2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
 
3. Download and prepare your dataset. See the `data/README.md` file for detailed instructions.

## Usage

1. Configure the model and training settings in the `config.py` file.

2. Run the training script:
python train.py

3. Generate images using a trained model:
python generate.py
